xcdebug notes
-------------
To finish installing xdebug for PHP 5.4:
  * /usr/local/etc/php/5.4/conf.d/ext-xdebug.ini was created,
    do not forget to remove it upon extension removal.
  * Validate installation via one of the following methods:
  *
  * Using PHP from a webserver:
  * - Restart your webserver.
  * - Write a PHP page that calls "phpinfo();"
  * - Load it in a browser and look for the info on the xdebug module.
  * - If you see it, you have been successful!
  *
  * Using PHP from the command line:
  * - Run "php -i" (command-line "phpinfo()")
  * - Look for the info on the xdebug module.
  * - If you see it, you have been successful!
